## Quick start
This is a normal flutter app. You should follow the instructions in the [official documentation](https://flutter.io/docs/get-started/install).
This project uses **BLoC** (business logic component) to separate the business logic with UI itself and uses **Modularization** approach to separate each modules.
It's recommended to do self-study about it in here (BLoC: [here](https://bloclibrary.dev/), Modularization: [here](https://medium.com/flutter-community/mastering-flutter-modularization-in-several-ways-f5bced19101a) and [here](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_modular)).


## Modularization Structure üî•

    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ features                 # Name of directory
    |   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ feature A, B, etc.   # Handling feature module with clean arch.
    |
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib                      # Name of module (default from Flutter)
    |
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ libraries                # Name of directory
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core                 # core module.
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dependencies         # dependencies module.

## Built With üõ†
* [Modularization](https://medium.com/flutter-community/mastering-flutter-modularization-in-several-ways-f5bced19101a) with [flutter_modular](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_modular) packages  - Separate functionality into independent, interchangeable modules.
* [Equatable](https://pub.dev/packages/equatable) - Being able to compare objects in `Dart` often involves having to override the `==` operator.
* [Json Serializable](https://pub.dev/packages/json_serializable) - Builders for handling JSON.
* [Dio](https://github.com/flutterchina/dio/) - A type-safe HTTP client.
* [BLoC Pattern](https://bloclibrary.dev/) - Business logic component to separate the business logic with UI.
* Handle State - (Loading, No Data, Has Data, No Internet Connection, Request Timeout, Error)
* [Flutter Screenutil](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_screenutil) - Responsive UI

* [ ] Integration Testing
* [ ] Code Coverage
* [ ] Publish to Play Store


## How to run Flutter App
Before run the app, make sure to generate file `*.g.dart`, you can use this command on terminal. But before you running that, make sure go to [list_news](https://github.com/rrifafauzikomara/NewsApp/tree/master/features/list_news) feature module first using `cd` command. For example `cd features` then `cd list_news`. Then you can run the command below.

One time build:
```console
flutter pub run build_runner build
```
or you can watch for changes and rebuild automatically
```console
flutter pub run build_runner watch
```
